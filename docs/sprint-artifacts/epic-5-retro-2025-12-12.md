# Retrospective: Epic 5 - Lifecycle Management

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Participants:** Carlos (User), SM, Architect, Dev
**Status:** Done

## Overview
Epic 5 focused on the lifecycle management of projects, specifically the ability to "Archive" projects to keep the active view clean, while still allowing historical access when explicitly requested. This was the final piece of the initial roadmap.

## What Went Well (Successes)

### 1. Minimal Invasive Changes
We implemented the archiving logic (`active: false`) and the historical search filter (`[ARCHIVED]`) purely through rule updates in `ingestor.mdc` and `oracle.mdc`. No structural changes to the file system (like moving folders) were necessary, which avoids broken paths and complexity.

### 2. Natural Language Intent
The Oracle agent's ability to discern when a user *wants* to see archived data (via keywords like "histórico", "antigo") versus when they don't proved to be a powerful, user-friendly feature. It adheres to the "Chaos In, Order Out" philosophy.

### 3. Roadmap Completion
With Epic 5 done, the core system F.R.E.Y.A. v1.0 is functionally complete. We have Ingestion, Recall, Career Management, and Lifecycle Management.

## What Could Be Improved (Challenges)

### 1. "Soft" Deletion vs. "Hard" Archiving
Currently, we only use a "soft" flag (`active: false`). As the `data/Clients` folder grows to thousands of projects, `Glob` performance *might* eventually degrade because we still scan everything. Future optimizations (v2.0) might consider physically moving folders to a `data/Archive` directory.

### 2. Testing Constraints
We tested with simulated scenarios. Real-world usage over months will reveal if the "Active" vs. "Archived" distinction holds up well or if users forget they archived something and get confused by "No records found".

## Action Items

1.  **Project Closeout:** Perform a final "System Health Check" to ensure all documentation is up to date.
2.  **User Onboarding:** Recommend the user strictly follow the `.mdc` personas.
3.  **Future Feature:** Consider a "Unarchive" feature if a project reactivates.

## Conclusion
Epic 5 is done. F.R.E.Y.A. is ready for daily use.
