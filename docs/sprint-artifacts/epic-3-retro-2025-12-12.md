# Epic 3 Retrospective: The Oracle (Recall & Retrieval)

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participants:** Carlos (User/Lead), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA)

## 1. Epic Summary

The Oracle is now live! We have successfully implemented the "Recall" capability of F.R.E.Y.A.

*   **Status:** Complete (3/3 Stories Done)
*   **Velocity:** High
*   **Key Deliverable:** The `oracle.mdc` agent which can Search, Read, Summarize, and Cite local data.

## 2. What Went Well (Successes)

*   **Search Strategy:** Using `Glob` with recursive patterns (`**/*{keyword}*/**`) proved effective for finding project folders even with slight naming variations (e.g., "Vivo" vs "vivo"). This addressed the risk identified in Epic 2.
*   **Anti-Hallucination:** The strict requirement for "Source Citation" (Story 3.3) adds a layer of trust. The agent now explicitly points to the file it read.
*   **Executive Summary:** The decision to not dump raw JSON but summarize `currentStatus` + `last 3 updates` (Story 3.2) makes the interaction much more pleasant and "human".

## 3. Challenges & Lessons Learned

*   **Date Formats:** We assumed `YYYY-MM-DD` in the JSON. If ingestion puts in `DD/MM/YYYY`, the sorting might break.
    *   *Lesson:* Ideally, we should enforce ISO 8601 strictly at Ingestion (Epic 2) to make Retrieval (Epic 3) easier.
*   **Performance:** Recursive globs can be slow on massive repos. For a personal "career repo", it's fine, but in a monorepo with 100k files, we'd need to scope the search better.

## 4. Action Items for Epic 4

1.  **Career Schema:** Ensure `career-log.json` entries have a clear `date` field for the "Brag Sheet" generator to filter by range. (Owner: Dev)
2.  **Date Filtering:** Story 4.2 will need logic to filter JSON arrays by date. We might need a helper tool or clear instructions for the LLM to do this math.

## 5. Readiness for Epic 4 (Career Coach)

*   **Dependencies:** Epic 2 (Ingestion) created the `career-log.json` path. Epic 3 established retrieval patterns. Epic 4 combines them for a specific domain.
*   **Blockers:** None.
*   **Status:** **READY TO START**.

## 6. Commitments

We commit to making the "Brag Sheet" (Story 4.2) a truly useful artifact for performance reviews, not just a list of raw data.
