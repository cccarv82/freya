# Retrospective: Epic 4 - Career Coach Module

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Participants:** Carlos (User), SM, Architect, Dev
**Status:** Done

## Overview
Epic 4 focused on building the "Career Coach" module, enabling the user to record long-term career data (achievements, feedback, certifications) and generate "Brag Sheets" for performance reviews. This module complements the project-focused features of previous epics.

## What Went Well (Successes)

### 1. Separation of Concerns (Architecture)
The decision to keep the **Ingestor** (Epic 2) as the sole "writer" and the **Coach** (Epic 4) as a "reader/analyst" was excellent. It prevents race conditions and logic duplication. The Coach agent simply routes "add" requests back to the Ingestor, maintaining a clean data flow.

### 2. Prompt-Based Logic for Dates
Instead of writing complex Python/JavaScript code to parse natural language dates like "last 6 months", we successfully leveraged the LLM's reasoning capabilities within the `coach.mdc` rules. The prompt instructs the model to calculate the start date relative to "Today", which is a robust and low-code solution.

### 3. Markdown Formatting
The "Brag Sheet" output format (grouped by category, with emojis) provides immediate value to the user, requiring no further formatting before being used in a real performance review context.

## What Could Be Improved (Challenges)

### 1. Test Artifacts vs. Prompt Examples
The story called for a separate `tests/career_examples.md` file for dry runs. The Developer chose to embed these as `<examples>` within the `.mdc` file itself. While efficient and effective for the agent's performance, it technically deviated from the "definition of done" task list. In the future, we should either update the plan to reflect this or enforce the artifact creation.

### 2. Validation of "Entry Strategy"
Since the entry strategy relies on the Ingestor (Epic 2), verifying it required checking if the Ingestor correctly tagged items as "Career". This dependency meant Epic 4's success was tightly coupled with Epic 2's robustness.

## Action Items

1.  **Monitor Log Size:** As `career-log.json` grows over years, we may need to introduce pagination or chunking (unlike project files which can be archived).
2.  **Epic 5 Alignment:** Ensure that the "Project Archiving" logic in Epic 5 does not interfere with Career Logs. Career data is generally lifetime data and should likely *never* be archived in the same way projects are.

## Conclusion
The Career Coach module is live and functional. It adds a personal dimension to F.R.E.Y.A., moving beyond just a project tracker to a true career assistant. We are ready for Epic 5.
