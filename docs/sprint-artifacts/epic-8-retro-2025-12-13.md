# Retrospective - Epic 8: Reporting Engine

**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Participants:** Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA), Winston (Architect), Carlos (User)

## Epic Summary
Epic 8 ("Reporting Engine") focused on extracting value from the data we've been collecting (Tasks, Career, Project Status). We implemented two key reporting tools: a comprehensive "Weekly Report" generator and a lightweight "Daily Summary" tool for standups.

**Metrics:**
- **Stories Completed:** 2/2 (100%)
- **Status:** Done
- **Blockers:** 0
- **Technical Debt:** 0 (Zero-dependency implementation)
- **Time:** Fast execution

## 1. What Went Well (Successes)
*   **Pattern Reuse:** We successfully adapted the "Script + Unit Test" pattern from Epic 7. Writing a standalone script (`scripts/generate-*.js`) with a companion simulation test (`tests/unit/test-*.js`) is now our proven standard for reliable feature delivery.
*   **Zero-Dependency Discipline:** We maintained the strict "Standard Node.js only" rule. Both reports generate pure Markdown/Text using only `fs` and `path`.
*   **Persona Integration:** We updated `master.mdc` immediately to make the Agent aware of the new `npm run report` and `npm run daily` capabilities. This closes the loop between "Tooling" and "UX".
*   **Scope Precision:** For Story 8.2 (Daily Summary), we correctly identified the need for "Ephemeral Text" (console output) rather than creating file clutter. This shows good product sense.

## 2. Challenges & Struggles
*   **Data Availability:** The reports rely on data existing in `task-log.json`, `career-log.json`, etc. If these files are empty, the reports are empty. We handled this gracefully in the code, but the *value* of the feature depends on the *usage* of the previous features.

## 3. Key Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **Ephemeral vs. Persistent:** Distinguishing between "Documents" (Weekly Report -> File) and "Snippets" (Daily Summary -> Console) is a key UX insight. Not everything needs to be saved to disk.
*   **Simulation Testing:** Testing logic with "Mock Data" is critical when dealing with Time/Date-based logic (e.g., "Last 7 days"). It allows us to verify edge cases without messing with the user's real system clock or data.

## 4. Continuity Analysis (From Epic 7)
*   **Epic 7 Lesson Applied:** "Tools as First-Class Citizens" - The reporting scripts are robust, error-handling CLI tools, not just hacks.
*   **Epic 7 Action Items:** `npm run health` (from Epic 7) ensures our data is valid before we try to report on it.

## 5. Action Items
| ID | Action | Owner | Priority | Status |
|----|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 8.1 | Use `npm run daily` for the next 5 days to verify it fits the workflow. | User | High | To Do |
| 8.2 | Consider adding a "Monthly Rollup" in the future if Weekly Reports prove valuable. | PO | Low | To Do |

## 6. Roadmap Check (Next Steps)
*   **Current State:** We have completed Epics 1 through 8.
*   **Roadmap:** The `sprint-status.yaml` currently tracks up to Epic 8. We need to check if there is an Epic 9 planned or if we need a "Roadmap Planning" session.
*   **Immediate Next Step:** If no Epic 9 exists, we should either define it or focus on using the system we've built.

**Status:** Completed
**Next Step:** Check Roadmap / Define Epic 9.
