# Retrospective - Epic 6: Task Management

**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Participants:** Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA), Carlos (User)

## Epic Summary
Epic 6 focused on implementing the **Personal Task Management** module ("Radar"), enabling the user to log, view, and complete tasks via chat. This completes the core "Order Out" capability for personal to-dos.

**Metrics:**
- **Stories Completed:** 4/4 (100%)
- **Status:** Done
- **Blockers:** 0
- **Technical Debt:** Low (JSON file size potential concern)

## 1. What Went Well (Successes)
*   **Prompt-Based Logic:** The `ingestor.mdc` and `oracle.mdc` agents successfully handled complex logic (intent recognition, entity extraction) purely through prompt instructions, without external code dependencies.
*   **Cycle Time:** Rapid implementation of the full CRUD cycle (Schema -> Ingestion -> Retrieval -> Completion).
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing `data/` structure. The separation of `task-log.json` from `career-log.json` and `status.json` proved to be a good architectural decision.
*   **Testing:** The use of standalone Node.js scripts (`tests/unit/*.js`) for verifying agent logic before "deployment" (updating prompts) was highly effective.

## 2. Challenges & Struggles
*   **Ambiguity Handling:** Teaching `ingestor.mdc` to distinguish between "Completing a Task" and "Updating a Project Status" required careful prompt tuning.
*   **ID Management:** We opted for simple IDs. In a multi-user or high-volume scenario, collision could be a risk, though negligible for single-user local usage.

## 3. Key Insights & Lessons Learned
*   **"Atomic" Instructions:** Giving agents specific "atomic" instructions (e.g., "Read file X", then "Find Y", then "Update Z") is more reliable than vague "manage tasks" commands.
*   **Simulation Testing:** Creating a mock test script *before* modifying the agent prompt is a pattern we should keep. It forces us to define the exact logic we want the agent to emulate.

## 4. Action Items
| ID | Action | Owner | Priority | Status |
|----|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 6.1 | Monitor `task-log.json` growth. If > 1MB, implement archival strategy. | Dev | Low | To Do |
| 6.2 | Refine `oracle.mdc` natural language summary to be more concise for long task lists. | UX/Dev | Medium | To Do |

## 5. Preparation for Next Epic (Epic 7: Validation & Health)
*   **Dependencies:** Epic 7 will build validation scripts for the data structures created in Epics 1-6. We are well-positioned as schemas are stable.
*   **Risks:** None identified.
*   **Readiness:** High. The system is stable.

**Status:** Completed
**Next Step:** Sprint Planning for Epic 7.
