# Epic 2 Retrospective: Universal Ingestion

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participants:** Carlos (User/Lead), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA)

## 1. Epic Summary

We delivered the core "Chaos In, Order Out" capability.

*   **Status:** Complete (4/4 Stories Done)
*   **Velocity:** High
*   **Key Deliverable:** The `ingestor.mdc` agent which handles Safe Logging, NLP Extraction, and Sharded Persistence.

## 2. What Went Well (Successes)

*   **Safe Logging Architecture:** The decision to log raw inputs *before* parsing (Story 2.1) is a huge win for data integrity. Even if the LLM hallucinates during parsing, the original data is saved.
*   **Schema Definition:** The strict JSON schema defined in `ingestor.mdc` (Story 2.2) makes the agent deterministic and easier to debug.
*   **Multi-Context Handling:** We successfully anticipated users mixing "Project Updates" with "Career Goals" in a single message.

## 3. Challenges & Lessons Learned

*   **Slug Generation Consistency:** There is a minor risk that `Vivo` becomes `vivo` today and `VIVO` tomorrow if the agent isn't strict. We added instructions for "lowercase kebab-case", but we need to monitor this in production.
    *   *Action:* In Epic 3 (Oracle), we need to make the search fuzzy enough to handle slight slug mismatches.
*   **Atomic Writes:** We are simulating atomicity by reading/writing the full file. As files grow large, this might become slow.
    *   *Lesson:* Good enough for now (local-first, single user), but keep an eye on performance for files > 1MB.

## 4. Action Items for Epic 3

1.  **Fuzzy Search:** When implementing the Oracle (Story 3.1), ensure it searches for `*vivo*` and not just exact match, to mitigate slug inconsistencies. (Owner: Dev)
2.  **Date Validation:** Ensure the Oracle can parse different date formats in the JSON history. (Owner: Dev)

## 5. Readiness for Epic 3 (The Oracle)

*   **Dependencies:** Data is now flowing IN. Epic 3 is about getting data OUT. We have the data structure ready.
*   **Blockers:** None.
*   **Status:** **READY TO START**.

## 6. Commitments

We commit to building a "Honest Oracle" that cites its sources (Story 3.3) to prevent hallucination.
