# Epic 1 Retrospective: The Core Agent System

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participants:** Carlos (User/Lead), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA)

## 1. Epic Summary

We successfully established the foundation of F.R.E.Y.A.

*   **Status:** Complete (4/4 Stories Done)
*   **Velocity:** High (Completed in single session)
*   **Key Deliverable:** Functional Agent Entry Point (`@freya`) and Persistence Layer.

## 2. What Went Well (Successes)

*   **Persona Definition:** The "Senior Scrum Master Coach" persona is well-defined in `master.mdc` with negative constraints, ensuring a professional tone from Day 1.
*   **Architecture Compliance:** The directory structure follows the architecture document precisely (`.agent/rules/freya`), avoiding `.cursor` vs `.agent` confusion.
*   **Documentation:** `README.md` and `project_context.md` were created early, enforcing constraints like "Local-First".

## 3. Challenges & Lessons Learned

*   **PowerShell Syntax:** We hit a minor snag with `mkdir -p` in PowerShell.
    *   *Lesson:* Prefer BMAD file tools over raw shell commands for cross-platform reliability.
*   **Placeholder Logic:** The Router (Story 1.2) currently points to non-existent agents.
    *   *Action:* We need to implement Epic 2 (Ingestor) quickly so the menu actually works.

## 4. Action Items for Epic 2

1.  **Shell Agnosticism:** Developers must use `Write`/`Read` tools instead of `Shell` for file ops where possible. (Owner: Dev Team)
2.  **Ingestion Robustness:** For Epic 2, we must test "chaos inputs" aggressively to ensure the parser doesn't break. (Owner: QA)

## 5. Readiness for Epic 2 (Universal Ingestion)

*   **Dependencies:** All prerequisites from Epic 1 are met.
*   **Blockers:** None.
*   **Status:** **READY TO START**.

## 6. Commitments

We commit to maintaining the "Local-First" integrity as we start writing actual logic in Epic 2.
